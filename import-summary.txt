ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/android-dev-logging.jar => app/libs/android-dev-logging.jar
* libs/gimbal-proximity.jar => app/libs/gimbal-proximity.jar
* libs/spring-android-core-1.0.1.RELEASE.jar => app/libs/spring-android-core-1.0.1.RELEASE.jar
* libs/spring-android-rest-template-1.0.1.RELEASE.jar => app/libs/spring-android-rest-template-1.0.1.RELEASE.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/main/java/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
